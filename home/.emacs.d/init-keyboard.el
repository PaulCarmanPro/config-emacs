;; (define-key KEYMAP KEY DEF)
;; 1. keymap overriding-terminal-local-map is for terminal-specific key binds.
;; 2. keymap overriding-local-map is for keys that override all other local keymaps.
;; 3. keymap char property at point is for keymaps that are local to the character point is at.
;; 4. keymap emulation-mode-map-alists is for advanced multi-mode keymap management.
;; 5. keymap minor-mode-overriding-map-alist is for overriding the keymaps used by minor modes in major modes.
;; 6. keymap minor-mode-map-alist is the preferred means of specifying the keymaps for minor modes.
;; 7. keymap text property at point is like the one above for char properties but is for text properties only.
;; 8. (current-local-map) is for keymaps defined in the buffersâ€™ current local map.
;;    `(local-set-key KEY COMMAND)'
;; 9. (current-global-map) is the last place Emacs will look for key binds and it is for the global ones.
